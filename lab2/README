Lab 2: GF Mini Resource Grammar

This lab follows Chapters 5 to 8 of the Notes, but a bit less loosely.
The abstract syntax will be given here.

==Chapter 5==

+ Design a morphology for the main lexical types (N, A, V) with parameters and a couple of paradigms.
+ Test it by implementing the Mini lexicon.

==Chapter 6==

+ Define the linearization types of main phrasal categories (S, VP, NP, CN, Det, AP).
+ Define the linearization rules for the main rules covering these categories.

==Chapter 7==

+ Complete the definitions of RGL categories and functions.
+ Add concrete UD labels.
+ Generate a synthetic UD treebank.


==Chapter 8==

+ Implement a simple application grammar (to be given in this directory).
