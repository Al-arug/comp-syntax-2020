# Lab 2: Multilingual generation and translation

This lab corresponds to Chapters 5 to 9 of the Notes, but follows them
only loosely.
Therefore we will structure it according to the exercise sessions
rather than chapters.
The abstract syntax will be given in this directory.

## Session 5

1. Design a morphology for the main lexical types (N, A, V) with parameters and a couple of paradigms.
2. Test it by implementing the Mini lexicon.

## Session 6

1. Define the linearization types of main phrasal categories (S, VP, NP, CN, Det, AP).
2. Define the linearization rules for the main rules covering these categories.

## Session 7

1. Complete the definitions of RGL categories and functions.
2. Add concrete UD labels.
3. Generate a synthetic UD treebank.


## Session 8

1. Implement a simple application grammar (to be given in this directory).
