# Part 3
The approach adopted to adapt [the given English grammar](https://github.com/harisont/comp-syntax-2020/blob/master/lab1/chapter4/English.dbnf) to [Spanish](https://github.com/harisont/comp-syntax-2020/blob/master/lab1/chapter4/Spanish.dbnf) is to simply see what problems the Spanish syntax trees generated by gf-ud present and modify the grammar accordingly, __starting from the observations listed in [part2.md](https://github.com/harisont/comp-syntax-2020/blob/master/lab1/chapter4/part2.md)__.

3.

Other changes made:
