# Part 2

## Method
A possible approach to test [the given English grammar](https://github.com/harisont/comp-syntax-2020/blob/master/lab1/chapter4/English.dbnf) is to simply run `gf-ud dbnf English.dbnf Utt` on the various sentences.
However, the CONLL files obtained in this way, like

```
# text = A small town with two minarets glides by.
# analyses = 0
# parsetree = (Chunks (Str A) (Str small) (Str town) (Prep with) (Str two) (Str minarets) (Str glides) (Str 'by.'))
1	A	_	X	_	_	8	dep	_	_
2	small	_	X	_	_	8	dep	_	_
3	town	_	X	_	_	8	dep	_	_
4	with	_	ADP	_	_	8	dep	_	_
5	two	_	X	_	_	8	dep	_	_
6	minarets	_	X	_	_	8	dep	_	_
7	glides	_	X	_	_	8	dep	_	_
8	by.	_	X	_	_	0	root	_	_
```
are of little to no interest. Results worth comparing with the hand-drawn phrase structure trees from [part 1](https://github.com/harisont/comp-syntax-2020/blob/master/lab1/chapter4/part1.pdf) can only be obtained by passing the parser POS-tagged sentences, which can be found in two [automatically generated](https://github.com/harisont/comp-syntax-2020/blob/master/lab1/postagger.py) files ([en-pos.conll](https://github.com/harisont/comp-syntax-2020/blob/master/lab1/chapter4/en-pos.conll) and [es-pos.conll](https://github.com/harisont/comp-syntax-2020/blob/master/lab1/chapter4/es-pos.conll)). The output of running `gf-ud dbnf English.dbnf Utt` on these two files can be found in [parsed_postagged_sentences-en.conll](https://github.com/harisont/comp-syntax-2020/blob/master/lab1/chapter4/parsed_postagged_sentences-en.conll) and [parsed_postagged_sentences-es.conll](https://github.com/harisont/comp-syntax-2020/blob/master/lab1/chapter4/parsed_postagged_sentences-es.conll).

## General comments
- when it comes to the number of sentences `gf-ud` is unable to build a parse tree for at all (7/24 in Spanish, 4/24 in English), the given grammar seems -unsurprisingly- to work better on the English corpus
- no sentence is unambiguous in any of the language: when the program is in fact able to parse the sentences, it always returns two trees at least (often many more)

## Correctness of the automatically generated trees
Considering that:

- the hand-drawn phrase-structure trees do not strictly follow any precise convention, let alone that of the trees generated by `gf-ud`
- they are, by definition, _hand drawn_, meaning that they cannot be efficiently converted into bracketed strings
- they are the first syntax trees I draw

it is not reasonable to consider them as the "gold standard" to compare the automatically generated sentences to (in particular, it does not make sense to evaluate the accuracy of the parser by running `gf-ud eval`).

This will not prevent us to make some informal comparisons between hand-drawn and automatically generated phrase structure trees and to evaluate the accuracy of dependency parsing via `gf-ud eval` (when it comes to dependency trees, we have in fact some sort of "silver standard": the standard CONLL files found in [the previous chapter's folder](https://github.com/harisont/comp-syntax-2020/tree/master/lab1/chapter3)).

## Phrase structure trees


TODO:
- compare phrase structure trees anyway
- compare dependency trees via eval (?)
