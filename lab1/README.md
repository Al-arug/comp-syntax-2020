# Lab 1: Grammatical analysis


This lab follows Chapters 1-4 in the course notes. Each part is started after the lecture on the corresponding chapter.
The assignments are submitted via Canvas.

## Chapter 1: explore the parallel UD treebank (PUD)

1. Go to https://universaldependencies.org/ and download Version 2.5 treebanks
2. Look up the Parallel UD treebanks for those 19 languages that have it. They are named e.g. UD_English-PUD/
3. Select a language to compare with English.
4. Make statistics about the frequencies of POS tags and dependency labels in your language compared with English.
  For instance, the top-10 tags/labels and their number of occurrences.
  What does this tell you about the language?
5. Convert 2x2 tree from CoNLL format to graphical tree by hand, on paper.
  Select a short English tree and its translation.
  Then select a long English tree and its translation.
6. Draw word alignments for some non-trivial example in the PUD treebank, on paper.
  Use the same trees as in the previous question.
  What can you say about the syntactic differences between the languages?


## Chapter 2: design the morpological types of the major parts of speech in your selected language

1. It is enough to cover NOUN, ADJ, and VERB.
2. Use a traditional grammar book or a Wikipedia article to identify the inflectional and inherent features.
3. Then use data from PUD to check which morphological features actually occur in the treebank for that language. 

## Chapter 3: UD syntax analysis

Take a bilingual "corpus" with English and your own language, and annotate with UD. Details to appear later


## Chapter 4: phrase structure analysis==

1. Write a set of liberal phrase structure rules for your selected language covering the same structures as the Notes. 
2. The English grammar gathered from the Notes will appear in this Git directory.
