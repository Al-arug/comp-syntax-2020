Lab 1: Grammatical analysis


This lab follows Chapters 1-4 in the course notes. Each part is started after the lecture on the corresponding chapter.
The assignments are submitted via Canvas.

==Chapter 1: explore the parallel UD treebank (PUD)==

+ Go to https://universaldependencies.org/ and download Version 2.5 treebanks
+ Look up the Parallel UD treebanks for those 19 languages that have it. They are named e.g. UD_English-PUD/
+ Select a language to compare with English.
+ Make statistics about the frequencies of POS tags and dependency labels in your language compared with English.
  For instance, the top-10 tags/labels and their number of occurrences.
  What does this tell you about the language?
+ Convert 2x2 tree from CoNLL format to graphical tree by hand, on paper.
  Select a short English tree and its translation.
  Then select a long English tree and its translation.
+ Draw word alignments for some non-trivial example in the PUD treebank, on paper.
  Use the same trees as in the previous question.
  What can you say about the syntactic differences between the languages?


==Chapter 2: design the morpological types of the major parts of speech in your selected language==

+ It is enough to cover NOUN, ADJ, and VERB.
+ Use a traditional grammar book or a Wikipedia article to identify the inflectional and inherent features.
+ Then use data from PUD to check which morphological features actually occur in the treebank for that language. 

==Chapter 3: UD syntax analysis==

+ Take a bilingual "corpus" with English and your own language, and annotate with UD. Details to appear later


==Chapter 4: phrase structure analysis==

+ Write a set of liberal phrase structure rules for your selected language covering the same structures as the Notes. 
+ The English grammar gathered from the Notes will appear in this Git directory.
